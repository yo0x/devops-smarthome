The typical folder structure for an Ansible module involves placing the module within a library directory at the root of your Ansible project. Here's an example of what this might look like:

ansible_project/
├── library/
│   └── my_module.py
├── roles/
│   ├── role1/
│   │   ├── tasks/
│   │   │   └── main.yml
│   │   ├── handlers/
│   │   │   └── main.yml
│   │   ├── templates/
│   │   ├── files/
│   │   └── vars/
│   │       └── main.yml
│   └── role2/
│       ├── tasks/
│       │   └── main.yml
│       ├── handlers/
│       │   └── main.yml
│       ├── templates/
│       ├── files/
│       └── vars/
│           └── main.yml
├── hosts.ini
└── playbook.yml

In this structure, my_module.py is a custom Ansible module. It's placed in the library directory at the root of the project, so it can be used in any playbook or role within the project.

The roles directory contains Ansible roles, each of which has its own directory. Each role directory contains several subdirectories for tasks, handlers, templates, files, and vars.

The hosts.ini file is an inventory file that lists the hosts where your playbooks will be run.

The playbook.yml file is an Ansible playbook that uses the roles and custom modules in your project.
