# values.yaml for n8n Helm Chart

# Image configuration
image:
  repository: n8nio/n8n
  tag: latest # As per your desired config; chart appVersion is the default if empty
  pullPolicy: Always # As per your desired config

# n8n specific configurations that are non-sensitive
config:
  # n8n Editor URL
  N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL: "https://n8n.yonor.me"
  N8N_SECURE_COOKIE: "false"
  # n8n Webhook URL (if different from editor URL or needs to be explicit)
  N8N_WEBHOOK_URL: "https://n8n.yonor.me"

  # Executions mode
  # Note: The chart documentation lists 'main' or 'own' for 'executions.process'.
  # 'queue' mode is enabled by setting EXECUTIONS_MODE and configuring Redis.
  EXECUTIONS_MODE: "queue" # For queue mode

  # Database Configuration (PostgreSQL)
  database:
    type: postgresdb
    postgresdb:
      host: "192.168.1.126"
      user: "postgres"
      # database: "n8n" # Default is n8n, uncomment to override
      # port: 5432       # Default is 5432, uncomment to override
      # schema: "public" # Default is public, uncomment to override
      ssl:
        # rejectUnauthorized is 'true' in your config.
        # The chart default is also true.
        rejectUnauthorized: true
        # ca, cert, key fields expect certificate content.
        # For using a CA file, we'll use extraEnv DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_CA_FILE
        # and mount the CA certificate via extraVolumes/extraVolumeMounts.
        # ca: ""
        # cert: ""
        # key: ""

  # PostgreSQL Pool Size (using direct n8n environment variable)
  DB_POSTGRESDB_POOL_MAX: 10

  # Queue Mode Health Check (using direct n8n environment variable)
  N8N_QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_ACTIVE: "true" # n8n often expects string for boolean env vars

  # Queue Mode Bull Redis Configuration (using direct n8n environment variables)
  # These will point to the Valkey/Redis service.
  # If using the embedded redis, the chart might auto-configure this.
  # However, explicitly setting helps if using an external or specifically named internal service.
  N8N_QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_HOST: "n8n-valkey-primary" # Service name of your Valkey/Redis
  N8N_QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_PORT: 6379

# n8n specific configurations that are sensitive and will be stored in a Kubernetes Secret
secret:
  # n8n Encryption Key
  N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY: "yonor" # !! IMPORTANT: Replace "yonor" with a strong, unique key in production !!

  # database:
    # postgresdb:
      # password: "your_postgres_password_here"
      # If DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD is set via extraEnv from a secretKeyRef (as in your example),
      # then this field might not be needed, assuming n8n prioritizes the env var.
      # If the chart requires this to be set to create its own DB secret or pass to n8n,
      # you might need to ensure its value aligns or use a mechanism to populate it.

# Additional environment variables for the n8n deployment(s)
extraEnv:
  DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD:
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: db-app # Kubernetes secret containing the DB password
        key: password # Key within the secret 'db-app'
  N8N_ENFORCE_SETTINGS_FILE_PERMISSIONS: "true"
  # Environment variable for PostgreSQL SSL CA certificate file path
  DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_CA_FILE: "/home/ssl/certs/postgresql/ca.crt"

# The n8n Helm chart documentation provided does not explicitly list `extraVolumeMounts` or `extraVolumes`
# at the root level. However, many Helm charts support this for custom volume configurations.
# If the chart does not support these keys globally, these settings might not apply as expected
# or might need to be configured differently (e.g., via a custom pod template if supported).
# These are based on your 'main.extraVolumeMounts' and 'main.extraVolumes'.
# If scaling is enabled, it's assumed workers/webhooks might inherit or need similar mounts.
extraVolumeMounts:
  - name: db-ca-cert
    mountPath: /home/ssl/certs/postgresql # Mount directory for the CA cert
    readOnly: true

extraVolumes:
  - name: db-ca-cert
    secret:
      secretName: db-ca # Kubernetes secret containing the ca.crt
      items:
        - key: ca.crt
          path: ca.crt # File name within the mount path

# Resource requests and limits for the main n8n deployment
resources:
  limits:
    memory: 2048Mi
  requests:

  # limits:
  #   cpu: 100m
  #   memory: 128Mi
  # requests:
  #   cpu: 100m
  #   memory: 128Mi

# Persistence configuration (example, adjust as needed)
# persistence:
#   enabled: true
#   size: 1Gi
#   # storageClass: "-" # Or your specific storage class
#   accessModes:
#     - ReadWriteOnce

# Scaling configuration for workers and webhooks (Queue Mode)
scaling:
  enabled: true # This enables queue mode and worker instances
  worker:
    count: 2 # Default is 2 when scaling.enabled is true. Adjust if needed.
    # concurrency: 2 # Default concurrency per worker
  webhook:
    enabled: true # Enables dedicated webhook processor instances
    count: 1 # Default is 1. Adjust if needed.
  # Configuration for an external Redis if not using the embedded one.
  # If redis.enabled below is true, these are typically ignored or auto-configured.
  # redis:
  #   host: "n8n-valkey-primary" # Matches your N8N_QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_HOST
  #   port: 6379                # Matches your N8N_QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_PORT
  #   password: "your-redis-password-if-set"

# Embedded Redis (Valkey) configuration
# Based on your 'valkey' section, mapping to the chart's 'redis' section
# (assuming it uses a Bitnami-like Redis subchart).
redis:
  enabled: true # Deploy the embedded Redis (Valkey)
  architecture: standalone # As per your 'valkey.architecture'
  # For Bitnami Redis chart: 'master' for standalone, or primary settings.
  master: # Corresponds to your 'primary' block for Valkey
    # kind: Deployment # This is often controller by the sub-chart, usually StatefulSet for persistence
    persistence:
      enabled: false # As per your 'valkey.primary.persistence.enabled'
    resources: # As per your 'valkey.primary.resources'
      requests:
        memory: 256Mi
        cpu: 100m
  # replica: # Configuration for Redis replicas if architecture is replication
  #   replicaCount: ...
  sentinel:
    enabled: false # As per your 'valkey.sentinel.enabled'
  auth:
    enabled: false # As per your 'valkey.auth.enabled'
    # password: "your-redis-password" # Set if auth.enabled is true
# password: "your-redis-password" # Set if auth.enabled is true

# Ingress configuration
ingress:
  enabled: true
  className: "nginx" # Matches your working Ingress and is common for Nginx Ingress Controller
  annotations:
    # Essential for SSL with cert-manager and Let's Encrypt
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"
    # Tells Nginx that the backend service (n8n) expects HTTP
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: "HTTP"
    # Rewrites the path to "/" before sending to the n8n service.
    # Useful if n8n expects all requests at its root, regardless of Ingress path.
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: "/"
    # Add any other Nginx specific annotations you might need, for example:
    # nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: "50m" # If n8n handles large uploads
  hosts:
    - host: "n8n.yonor.me"
      paths:
        - "/kami" # This will create the main rule for n8n.
              # If webhook.enabled is true (see below), the template will also use this
              # as a base to generate paths like /webhook/, /form/, etc.
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - "n8n.yonor.me"
      # This secret will store the TLS certificate for n8n.yonor.me.
      # Ensure cert-manager has permissions to create/update it.
      secretName: "n8n-yonor-me-tls"

# Note on related values (these typically reside outside the 'ingress:' block but are used by the Ingress template):
# The Ingress template refers to service ports like $.Values.main.service.port and $.Values.webhook.service.port
# You might have sections like this in your values.yaml:
#
# main:
#   service:
#     port: 5678 # Or whatever port your main n8n service listens on internally. Template defaults to 80.
#
# webhook:
#   enabled: true # Set to true if you use n8n's webhook functionality.
#                 # This will enable the additional path rules in the Ingress template.
#                 # Set to false if you only need the main path ("/") for n8n.
#   service:
#     port: 5678 # Or whatever port your n8n webhook process listens on. Template defaults to 80.
#                # Often this is the same port as the main service if n8n handles all routes internally.

# Other common Kubernetes settings (defaults shown in chart documentation)
